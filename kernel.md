# Support for backported kernels
The backported kernels draw their fixes directly from upstream but with a delay. The Liquorix kernels track upstream more closely but they 
are not signed with Microsoft's Secure Boot keys. Swings and roundabouts :)

The stable kernel is always the best option: security fixes are applied very quickly, it doesn't suffer the constant stream of upstream 
regressions and Secure Boot is supported.
